### Instructions

* With a partner, spend a few moments outlining all the steps and conditions that go into a single game of rock paper scissors.

* Try to break it down into steps that you could code out.

* Think of basic elements like loops, if-else statements, arrays, alerts, etc.

* Be prepared to share your outlines approach.

var user = prompt("which you gonna choose, rock, paper, scissors?)
var computer = random choice from rock, paper, scissors

if ( user = computer) {
    console.log("tie")
} else if (user = "rock" && computer = "paper" ) {
    console.log("you lose")
} else if (user = "")

create an array include "r", "p", "s";

create a prompt for user's input;

let computer choose a random one in the array;

compare computer's to user's choise:

if user = computer, then tie;

if user = r and computer = p, then user lose, computer win;

if user = r and computer = s, then user win, computer lose;

if user = p and computer = r, then user win, computer lose;

if user = p and computer = s, then user lose, computer win;

if user = s and computer = r, then user lose, computer win;

if user = s and computer = p, then user win, computer lose
